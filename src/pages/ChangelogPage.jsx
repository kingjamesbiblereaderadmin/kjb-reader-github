const CHANGELOG = [
  { version: 'v0.4.193', date: 'August 22, 2026', items: ['Re-enabled Bible reference detection inside existing hyperlinks — clicking a detected verse reference in a link now opens the KJB Reader side panel directly (restores pre-choice-menu behavior)', 'Fixed side panel not opening after service worker restart — stale panel-open flag from storage caused the background to skip opening the panel on verse clicks'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.192', date: 'August 22, 2026', items: ['Replaced dynamic daily verse with a static 2 Timothy 2:15 banner in the sidebar — no API call required, consistent display', 'Removed hyperlink choice menu for a cleaner click experience', 'Switched to promise-based side panel activation to eliminate the "page captured" flash during panel initialization', 'Fixed JavaScript syntax error that broke sidebar parsing on some browsers'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.184', date: 'August 19, 2026', items: ['Fixed the legal footer sitting behind the browser address bar on mobile. The panel is now sized to the visible viewport rather than the full-screen height, so nothing is laid out underneath the browser toolbars — this matters most in Edge and Opera on Android, which place the address bar at the bottom of the screen.', 'The footer is now compact and stays on screen in landscape instead of being reachable only after scrolling to the end of a chapter.', 'The footer now also clears the home indicator and rounded display corners on modern phones.', 'The in-page overlay is sized the same way, so its lower edge is no longer covered by browser chrome.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.190', date: 'August 19, 2026', items: ['Fixed PWA verse-click overlay being refused by content script when the background detected standalone mode but the content script\u2019s own detectStandalone() missed it (e.g., "Create shortcut" windows where display-mode is browser)', 'Fixed sidePanel.open() resolving silently in PWA windows with no visible panel — timeout now checks for a panel heartbeat and falls back to the in-page overlay via window-type detection', 'Increased fallback timeout to 1000ms to allow the side panel heartbeat to arrive for normal tabs before triggering a fallback'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.189', date: 'August 19, 2026', items: ['sidePanel.open() rejection now marks the tab as standalone so the timeout uses the overlay path instead of the popup-window path', 'Dynamic standalone check inside the timeout — was previously pre-computed before sidePanel.open() could reject, using a stale value', 'Toolbar click (onClicked) now tries sidePanel.open() and falls back to the in-page overlay on rejection for PWA windows'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.188', date: 'August 19, 2026', items: ['Removed all chrome.sidePanel.setOptions() calls that were wiping the manifest\u2019s default side panel path for normal tabs, causing every verse click to fall back to a popup window'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.187', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Reverted openPanelOnActionClick to true — normal tabs now open the side panel instantly on toolbar click as before', 'Removed setOptions calls that were breaking the side panel path'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.185', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Fixed PWA overlay being suppressed by stale side panel heartbeats from other tabs — background now skips the heartbeat check for standalone tabs and forwards the force flag to the overlay injector'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.184', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Switched to dynamic small-viewport units (dvh) for mobile overlays to prevent content truncation by browser UI chrome', 'Hardened build pipeline to derive file lists from manifests, preventing stale packaging', 'Updated Edge API endpoints to v1.1 (api.addons.microsoftedge.microsoft.com)'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.183', date: 'August 19, 2026', items: ['Fixed the reading area becoming invisible and impossible to scroll on short viewports, such as mobile landscape and small popup windows. The panel now scrolls as a single document instead of a clipped full-height column, so the reading area can no longer collapse to nothing.', 'The legal footer is pinned to the bottom edge of the panel instead of sitting at the very end of the document.', 'Verified across interface zoom levels from 75% to 150% in both portrait and landscape orientations.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.182', date: 'August 19, 2026', items: ['Fixed printing when the extension is opened from the browser menu on mobile. Print now opens a dedicated print page in a new tab: on Chromium-based mobile browsers (Edge for Android, Kiwi) the print dialog opens automatically, and on Firefox for Android \u2014 which cannot open a print dialog from a script \u2014 the page provides a \u201CPrint / Save as PDF\u201D button plus guidance to use the browser\u2019s own Print or Share option. This replaces the earlier fallback chain from v0.4.145, which reported success on mobile without ever printing.', 'Improved the print page to carry the scripture styling of the document being printed, with the on-screen toolbar automatically hidden on the printed page.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.181', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Fixed the long-standing brief flash of an in-page overlay when clicking a Bible reference on Chrome, Edge and Opera, caused by modern Chromium browsers also defining the \u201Cbrowser\u201D namespace historically unique to Firefox; browser detection is now based on the user agent and a Firefox-only API.'] },

  { version: 'v0.4.179', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Fixed the brief flash of the default text size when opening the side panel by applying the saved interface scale before the panel\u2019s first paint rather than after loading from storage.', 'Fixed a small layout shift on open caused by the Verse of the Day banner.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.178', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Fixed the first verse click after opening the panel not reliably showing the requested verse by handing the verse to the panel through the page address.', 'Improved the header title to scale down to fit the available width, with a fallback for browsers that do not support container queries.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.177', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['At high zoom levels, moved the header title onto its own row and reduced its size instead of dropping the logo and branding, with layout tiers derived from the panel\u2019s actual available width.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.176', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Fixed the first verse click after opening the panel occasionally showing the previous content, caused by two delivery paths racing each other.'] },

  { version: 'v0.4.174', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Removed the "scripting" permission entirely. It could never have worked without broad host access, so instead of requesting more permissions, an outdated content script now stands down on its own after an update and shows a small "reload this page" notice instead of acting.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.173', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Fixed interface zoom on browsers without CSS zoom support (Firefox before 126, including ESR builds): the panel now detects support at runtime and falls back to transform-based scaling with matching geometry, so no side gaps or clipped edges at any zoom level.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.172', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Clicking a verse now opens the real side panel instead of a popup window, by requesting it while the click is still active. A popup remains only as a fallback.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.171', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Added a DOM guard that instantly removes any leftover in-page overlay injected by an outdated copy of the extension in tabs that have not been reloaded.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.170', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['The page now learns from the extension whether the browser has a real side panel, and refuses in-page overlays on browsers that do — except as a genuine last resort.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.169', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Fixed the context-menu lookup path bypassing the single-surface rule, and tightened the rule so two simultaneous requests can never open two windows.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.168', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Verse lookups now settle on one surface only: any overlay is withdrawn the moment a real panel or window takes the verse.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.167', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Improved detection of whether the side panel is already open, so lookups are routed to it rather than duplicating it.'] },
  { version: 'v0.4.166', date: 'August 18, 2026', items: ['Verse clicks on Chrome and Edge no longer create an in-page overlay: the verse goes to the side panel, with a lookup window as fallback. Content scripts are now version-stamped so an updated version reliably takes over.'] },
